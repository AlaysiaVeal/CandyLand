### **Description**

#### A Candy Land Board Game with one player and 2 multicolored die to decide which space to land on. One is for the regular spaces a player could land on and the other is for the special spaces with images of gingerbread, snowflakes, mint, and even black licorice.

### **Function**

#### I looped through color array for both dice and added an event listener. I also added event listeners to playable game cells to move game piece.
