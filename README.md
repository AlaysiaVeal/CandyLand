### **Description**

#### A Candy Land Board Game with multiple players and 2 multicolored die to decide which space to land on. One is for the regular spaces a player could land on and the other is for the special spaces with images of gingerbread, snowflakes, mint, and even black licorice. Once a player wins a congratulations message pops up on the screen. A score is also kept after each game.
