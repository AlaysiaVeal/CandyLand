<h4>How to play - My CandyLand is a bit different from the original. The rules are you roll the first dice and move to the designated color. The second dice is for the special spaces with candy on them except for the black licorice. The special rules are: The gingerbread means you advance 4 paces forward. The mint means you go back 1. The snowflake mean you go back 4 paces. Finally the black licorice means you lose the game. </h4>
